#Section 1
##1 – Use a discrete density-dependent and -independent population model to assess the population growth 
##dynamics of any three species within the 10 most abundant species. What can you infer from both models 
##(Modeli | Speciesi)? For each species, what is the most proper model to assess their growth? Why?

##2 – Based on the selected models, how does lambda change across time?

##3 – Starting with the average abundance in 2000, perform a simulation (N = 100 replicates) of population 
##growth using the growth variability based on the abundance values from start to 1999 (i.e., use 100 samples 
##of lambda from 1980 to 1999’s frequency distribution to project population beyond 2000). How many times 
##are the real abundance values intercepted by the uncertainty bounds of the simulation (i.e., values within 
##the 95% confidence intervals)? Briefly discussed the performance of the models and potential reasons for 
##the results.

#Section 2
##1 – Does the sampling assigned to your group reach the asymptote of the species accumulation curve? Discuss results.

##2 - Using the species that composed 75% of the abundance of species within the nektonic community, assess 
##the annual trends of alpha and beta diversity, and the inverse Simpson diversity index.

##3 – Using a community trajectory analysis, assess the annual stability of the fish community across the 
##sites from the assigned basin and gear type. Describe and discuss the main results.
